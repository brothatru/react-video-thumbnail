# React Video Thumbnail
Given a video url, attempt to generate a video thumbnail using HTML Canvas Element

Note*: The **`<Canvas>`** element will only be able to generate a thumbnail, if CORS allows it.

If not, you may see a similar console error as below:
```
DOMException: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on 'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported.
```

Please read about [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), if you would like more details on how it works.
